# No Framework
This is the simplest framework in the world! Just download it and start writing your code!

###Truely Simplest?
Yes. All you have to do is `git clone` and then start writing your code! If you want to create a new `Class`, create a new file, and that's it!

### What Language is available?
See what branch we have, and that's all! If you want to create 'No Framework' in different language, send a pull request!

###So, Is This a Joke?
Of course, yes. Because I found myself often having an argument with teammate when choosing a framework, so I designed the __best__ framework in the world! Though this is a joke, you can still use it if you want.
